# Tic Tac Toe

https://rache02.github.io/Game/

This is a version of the classic game tic tac toe with a coding theme to the styling. The aim of the game is to get three X or O in a row to win. Each player takes a turn until the aim or the game is achieved or the game is considered a draw if neither player gets three in a row.

## Approach
The approach was broken down into first basic html, second logic for javascript and finally the css.

To create the basic html setup created nine divs. Other html elements were added at later stages during progress (as needed).

For the logic side first started out just adding the elements to the board if clicked. Created variable 'X' and 'O' and worked out the basics of how to input into divs. Then placed conditions so that current player switched between player1 and player2.

## Unsolved Problems
There are a number of unresolved problems:
- The game recorder is not functioning properly as continuously records wins after reset
- Reload is slow despite local image being called
- Does not look very good should have spent more time on css instead of being caught up in all the logic
- Was going to place keydown as well as click event listener but didnt have time
- Looks really ugly!!!
